# POKEAPI
##Task

We were tasked with testing an online api: <https://pokeapi.co/> and had to plan how to test the api.

As a group, we discussed how our Kanban board should be set out. The board consited of the following columns:

* Prioritise; 1 being high and 3 being low
* Execute
* Review
* Definition of done; has the code been peer reviewed and has it been indented properly, implementing DRY.

We then derived user stories which would assist us in creating our test cases/conditions, which were priortised from 1-3; 1 being the test which tests the most functional aspect of the API. Each member of the group took responsibilty on which user story they wanted to complete.

* I tested each endpoint in the location/utility resources. Ensuring that its in JSON format and that it returns the 200 code when given a valid ID.

* I tested that given an id for the evolution, games and items resources it returns the correct data e.g. a name returns the correct name in a string etc.
